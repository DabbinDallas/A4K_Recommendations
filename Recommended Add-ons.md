## POV
POV is a Movies and Tv add-on with a built in Scraper Module that can source from popular new websites/api's (Such as Torrentio, AIOstreams, and DMM). Based on Fenlight, POV is very fast, and it has many of the features from its predecessor. It is also actively maintained with weekly updates by Kodifitzwell, and is a highly recommended add-on on the A4K Subreddit and the easiest to setup among the 3 major Movie and Tv add-ons. I personally recommend this add-on to most new people when they dont know which add-on to start with.

## Umbrella
This Movie and Tv add-on started as a Venom fork that specializes in cached torrents, Easynews(web) account access, and also can use Magneto Module & CocoScrapers. It is actively maintained by the Umbrella_Dev and is Recommended alot in the A4K Subreddit, if you're looking for an add-on with LOADS of customization then this is the one you want. This is an advanced add-on so if you're new to Kodi then i'd say stick to one of the other Movie and Tv add-ons.
