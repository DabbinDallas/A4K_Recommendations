# Recommended Add-ons

## Seren
An addon created by Nix, it works with Premiumize and Real-Debrid to stream torrents with the appropriate provider package instantly, and behaves similarly to Netflix, with autoplay and Next up Dialogs. With source select / Resolver / Next up Dialog and more all theme-able. GitHub - a4k-openproject/a4kOfficial
> [!WARNING]
> This add-on DOES NOT work without either Premiumize, Real Debrid, or All-Debrid (and only works with the paid premium versions of either service), and the "Smart Play Settings" (Up Next, Auto Playlist Creation, Auto Episode Resume, and Pre-emptive Scraping) DO NOT work without an authorized Trakt account.

> - Adjust your setting how you like with filters and such and you're ready to go! :)
