# Welcome to the A4K_Recommendations wiki!
## What is kodi?
The following was taken directly from the [Kodi website](https://kodi.tv/):

Kodi® (formerly known as XBMC™) is an award-winning free and open source (GPL) software media center for playing videos, music, pictures, games, and more. Kodi runs on Linux, OS X, Windows, iOS, and Android, featuring a 10-foot user interface for use with televisions and remote controls. It allows users to play and view most videos, music, podcasts, and other digital media files from local and network storage media and the internet. Our forums and Wiki are bursting with knowledge and help for the new user right up to the application developer. We also have helpful Facebook, Google+, Twitter and Youtube pages.

The official Kodi version does not contain any content what so ever. This means that you should provide your own content from a local or remote storage location, DVD, Blu-Ray or any other media carrier that you own. Additionally Kodi allows you to install third-party plugins that may provide access to content that is freely available on the official content provider website. The watching or listening of illegal or pirated content which would otherwise need to be paid for is not endorsed or approved by Team Kodi.

## Addons
There are official Kodi addons (those supported by Team Kodi) and unofficial addons which are supported privately by their developers and user community. "Addons" are small snippets of code that allow Kodi to access online content from a variety of sources. For example, the YouTube Addon gives (gave) Kodi access to YouTube videos. Some addons source content from one site whilst others can source content from multiple sites. These can be downloaded in a zip file but are usually stored on repositories.

A "repository" is an online sever that developers can upload their addons to from which users can download them. Think a Dropbox or Google Drive account that only one person can upload to but everyone else can download from.

Kodi is an open source media player not a media provider. That means YOU must provide the content through local files, third-party addons or web based servers. Third party addons that "developers" provide to access torrented streaming through __Paid Debrid Providers__ are the most common used for Kodi on the A4K Subreddit but these are not official and there are no guarantees they will work properly on every setup (mostly due to bugs, api problems or user erorrs when setting up the addons). On the flip side, addons that use free providers to source their content (eg. Live TV, Sports, and P2P based Movies and TV addons) are usually short lived, require finicking around with different sources and quality can be iffy at best which is why its highly recommended to either use the Paid Provider Addons (in the case of Movies and TV shows) or Use a separate app like Tivimate with an IPTV subscription (in the case of Live TV and Sports) . With all that being said, Kodi itself is perfectly legal to use because it doesnt actually provide any content by itself rather provides ways to access content in a streamlined process.

## Where can I install Kodi?

Kodi can be installed on many devices - desktops, tablets, phones and a slew of other devices. This is usually more dependent on the operating system of the device than the device itself. To find out which devices and operating systems are compatible, check out https://kodi.tv/.

Deciding which device is best for you is a completely unique experience for every user. The question of which kodi box is the best is asked often but is difficult to answer definitively. This completely depends on what you want from your device. This question about Kodi boxes has been asked and covered extensively on various websites and the reddit posts. Here is a Reddit Post with a relatively updated discussion on [what android boxes people recommend](https://www.reddit.com/r/kodi/comments/1gmi79i/kodi_box_recommendations/) to help you with this decision. But id also highly recommend looking through multiple Google searches or other Reddit posts before making your decision as people have such varying opinions on which box to get, they can get kinda expensive on the higher end, and doing your own research for boxes that contain what you're looking for is usually the best course of action in this regard. 

__You will notice that the response is often the same though. Generally, users will get the following:__

- ### Budget options with Google Certification, DV and HD 10, and the ability for ethernet (sometimes requiring a usb to ethernet adapter) that are highly regarded are the Onn 4k Plus ($45), Onn 4k Pro ($30), and the Google Streamer ($75)

- ### Mid-Range options (some of them lack google certification so certain regular apps wont work work correctly but they usually have support for Corelec so if Kodi is all you're ruinning on the device it doesnt matter) would be Dune HD R Plus ($150), and the RockTek G2 ($130) 

- ### High tier boxes with the most features (Including Dolby Vision FEL 7, Losseless Audio Support like Atmos and True-HD, 1gb Ethernet Jacks, and support for Corelec [Kodi Specific Bootloaders]) are gonna run you a pretty penny but for the enthusiasts that only use these boxes for Kodi and want the best out of their experience, most will say that they're worth the money. These boxes include Nvidia Shield PRO 2019 ($200 although you can get a used one for cheaper they might require repasting the CPU for optimal performance), Ugoos AM6B Plus ($188), Ugoos SK1 ($244)

- ### If you don't mind some tinkering or want to experiment a bit, you could try a RaspberryPi. Though after the additional costs are considered, you may find that there are better alternatives for the price. Using this option also means you may have to pick up parts and peripherals such as a remote separately. ###

## ***Prices for these are from November 2025 so they're subject to change*** ##
If you want to ask this question on either the Kodi Forums or the Official Kodi Subreddits regarding which device to pick, you need to include some information about the points below so you can get a more customised individual response.

- what will you be using this device for in addition to Kodi.
- price range
- your own technical ability
- other technical requirements such as 5.1, DTS, DV, HDR 10/10+, Dolby Atmos, DTS-HD, True-HD, Optical Support or CEC

## Addons

As we've said, Kodi is a standalone media player that doesn't offer any content of its own.

There are official Kodi addons (those supported by Team Kodi) and unofficial addons which are supported privately by their developers and user community. "Addons" are small snippets of code that allow Kodi to access online content from a variety of sources. For example, the YouTube Addon gives (gave) Kodi access to YouTube videos. Some addons source content from one site whilst others can source content from multiple sites. These can be downloaded in a zip file but are usually stored on repositories.

A "repository" is an online sever that developers can upload their addons to from which users can download them. Think a Dropbox or Google Drive account that only one person can upload to but everyone else can download from.

A "build" is an installation of Kodi that someone has added repositories and addons to, made some sort of customisation and then shared for other users to download. It gives users a quick setup but is designed around the preferences of the build creator and as such, may not include all the addons each user would like or, as is often the case, the build is bloated with many addons the user neither needs or wants.

## Installing addons

There are many different ways to install addons. Users can add the relevant repository, download the individual addon zip file or use a third-party addon installer. In any case, the easiest way to accomplish this is by doing a Google search: Install [Addon Name] Kodi. If you're unsure about which addons you want, or want to know which addons are the most popular, check out the monthly sticky post in this sub in which users offer their suggestions. When installing any addon, it is also recommended to use the official repository for that addon. Some addons are available from multiple repositories but only the official repository for that addon is supported by the developer and will receive timely updates and maintenance. Avoid using mass repositories such as SuperRepo or similar which just host a plethora of addons but offer no maintenance or updates.

Addons have the same access to your system as Kodi, and can therefore be used to perform malicious tasks like steal credit card information and send spam without your knowledge. With this in mind, it is highly recommended that you only install addons from a trusted source and conduct reasonable research into what you are installing.

## Installing builds

TLDR: STAY AWAY FROM BUILDS THEY ARE JUST BLOATWARE TRASH. INSTALL YOUR ADDONS SEPERATELY, OPTIONALLY ADD A SKIN IF YOU WANT IT TO LOOK NICE, AND IF YOU WANT TO GET MORE ADVANCED THEN DO SOME RESEARCH ON WIDGETS TO ADD CUSTOM SHORTCUTS TO YOUR KODI HOMEPAGE.

Many factors can lead to degraded Kodi performance, including installing far too many addons and making graphical modifications to the Kodi interface. Unfortunately, this is also what makes many builds appealing. Some build makers also modify addon code that could result in addons breaking unnecessarily.

Some “builds” are known to disguise their code making it more difficult to determine what the code is really doing. This has lead to allegations of system hijacking and issues such as theft of personal information and using your device to hack or spam people. Privacy issues have also been raised with some builds including certain “phone home” functionality that communicates secretly in the background with the “build” creator’s servers.

When not set up properly, addons installed from the wrong repository (or without a repository at all) won’t update correctly in the future, which will mean that you’ll be stuck with broken addons. Using such “builds” makes it a lot more difficult (and frustrating) for addon developers to provide support to end users as many issues arise that would not occur under normal circumstances. It is always possible that one addon breaks another, which makes it very difficult to support issues for users who have too many Kodi addons installed.

## Safety

We've already mentioned that Kodi in itself is legal and can be used for legal purposes. This is, in fact, how it was developed and intended to be used. There are, however, illegal uses that can get unsuspecting and unprotected users into trouble.

Many users are already familiar with the issues surrounding torrenting media. If you are not, you may want to look into this and consider how this affects you.

PIRATING CONTENT IS ILLEGAL. It doesn't matter where you are or how you do it, pirating is illegal. The fact that law hasn't kept up to date with the methods of pirating is irrelevant. If you are streaming a movie for free through Kodi, that you would otherwise have to pay for, it is (will be) illegal and the laws will eventually catch up to include streaming if they don't already.

Most users (myself included) are aware of this and are content with milking the system and its lack of progress until such enforcement is enacted. It is, however, unlikely that individual consumers of the content will be targeted as opposed to the providers and suppliers of the content itself.

In terms of pirating content (that is effectively what you're doing by using piracy addons), most streaming addons connect to web servers that already host this content and only act as a portal of access to the user. Think accessing YouTube from the YouTube app as opposed to through the YouTube website. Some addons however use torrents and p2p streaming to access and share their content. This is where issues arise.

Most of the addons you'll see recommended in the monthly sticky post and suggested by users are the former, safer method. Usually if an addon uses torrents or p2p, it will be clearly labeled and sufficient warning is given. If you are unsure how an addon is accessing content, take the safe option and avoid it unless you have put in place safety measures. These could include subscribing to a VPN service, using a proxy or avoiding the content altogether.

## Maintenance

There are various maintenance addons that may improve some aspects of your Kodi experience. These could focus on improving your streaming performance, clearing disk space to improve device performance or other system tweaks that cater for unique tastes. You may want to conduct a Google search to find out which addons are currently servicing users as these addons will change from time to time.

## Common Questions/Issues

It is not often that you will experience something unique that no other user has experienced before nor have a question that has not yet been asked. In saying this, Google and Reddit are your friend. The world of Kodi and its addons is vast and ever-changing. It is because of this that for some, the learning curve to fully appreciate Kodi is quite steep. Being that this is the case, you will be better served by educating yourself and learning to find answers for yourself than having the answers fed to you. As was once said, "Give a man a fish, he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he will eat for a lifetime". Before posting about an issue you are experiencing or asking a general question, taking the time to write a complete backstory for context and then waiting for users construct an answer for you, check out our [FAQ page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Addons4Kodi/wiki/faq) if the issue is not covered there, break out the 5 or so keywords of your intended post and type them into the search bar. If you still can't find the response you're looking for, that's why we have this community.

Finally, enjoy Kodi responsibly, protect yourselves at all times, be safe, be mindful and most importantly, be entertained.
