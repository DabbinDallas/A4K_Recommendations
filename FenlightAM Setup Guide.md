# FenlightAM
## This is an add-on that specialises in Furk and Easynews(web) account access but offers external providers if you would like regular hosters as well.
> [!WARNING]
> - Requires paid premium providers (eg.Premiumize, Real Debrid, All-Debrid, etc.)
> - Requires a [External Scraper Module](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/External%20Scraper%20Modules.md) to function
> - Recommended to use a Watchlist Provider as well to keep track of what you watch and sync across devices (Trakt has the most features but TMDB lists kinda work as well)
