# Most of this is a W.I.P. and was directly forked from the original A4K Repo so if theres anything you want to add or correct/make easier to follow consider [submitting an issue](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/issues)

## Making a Recommendation
If youd like to make an addon recommendation to add to the recommended addons page then click on this [L I N K](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Make%20Recommendation.md), read through the example format and use as a template when submitting it as an issue in the link at the top of that page

## Recommended Addons
If you're looking for the recommended addons curated from the A4K subreddit ([FenlightAM](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Recommended%20Add-ons.md#fen-light-am), [Otaku](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Recommended%20Add-ons.md#otakuotaku-testing), [POV](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Recommended%20Add-ons.md#pov), and [Umbrella](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Recommended%20Add-ons.md#umbrella) are addons that are specifically maintained by moderaters on the subreddit and are the ones recommended most for Movies, TV and Anime) then click on "Recommended Add-ons.md" in the above box, click on the names of the addons above or click on this [L I N K](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Recommended%20Add-ons.md)

## Debrid Providers
If you're looking for a way to setup debrid providers in the most common addons then i've written a guide (Including pictures for each step) on how to do that with Real-Debrid as the example. You can access this page by clicking on "Debrid Providers.md" in the above box or click on this [L I N K](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Debrid%20Providers.md)

## External Scraper Modules
FenlightAM and Umbrella require external scraper modules to function so if you are getting an error message popup in either of those addons that says "No External Providers Enabled" (FenlightAM) OR "No Stream Available" (Umbrella) then you most likely havent enabled and authorized an external provider for those addons to use. To install one of the popular scraper modules follow this [L I N K](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/External%20Scraper%20Modules.md) and then go back to the recommended addons [L I N K](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Recommended%20Add-ons.md) and look for the [!NOTE] section of the install guide to learn how to enable it in your addon

## Language Setup
Alot of torrents that are uploaded on the sites that addons scrape end up playing in languages other than English by default. Instead of having to go into the player settings to change this everytime, you can change it Kodi-wide so it'll effect every addon that you use. You can access the guide for this by clicking on "Language Setup.md" in the above box or click on this [L I N K](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Language%20Setup.md)
