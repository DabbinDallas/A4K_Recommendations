## Getting Started with Kodi (W.I.P.)
If you'd like to know more about Kodi then consider visiting this [L I N K](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Getting%20Started%20(WIP).md) to read up on Kodi, learn more about Add-ons, Install/Device Resources, Safety issues, and Maintenence. This is one of the areas of the Repo that was fully reworked to include more up-to-date information so its worth checking out if you'd like to get better aquainted with Kodi's current landscape but as stated it's still a work in progress so take it as you will.

## Making a Recommendation
If you'd like to make an addon recommendation to add to the recommended addons page then click on this [L I N K](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Make%20Recommendation.md), read through the example format and use as a template when submitting it as an issue in the link at the top of that page

## Full Addon Setup Guides
The Recommended Addons section listed in the next section are barebones tutorials on how to get addons installed into your Kodi with some extra guidance for setting up certain parts of said addons but i've been slowly working on Full setup guides (with pictures for each step) for the most popular addons that include how to: __Install the addon onto Kodi, Setup External Scraper Modules, Add Watchlist Providers to keep track of your watch history/give more useability to the addons, and most importantly link up your Debrid Provider for each addon which is usually required for the addon to function__. So if you would like a more comprehensive guide to follow along, then you can click on the name of the addon you're trying to setup below ⬇️: 
### [FenlightAM](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Full%20Addon%20Setup%20Guides/FenlightAM%20Setup%20Guide.md) (MOVIES AND TV)
### [Otaku](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Full%20Addon%20Setup%20Guides/Otaku%20Setup%20Guide.md) (ANIME)
### [POV](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Full%20Addon%20Setup%20Guides/POV%20Setup%20Guide.md) (MOVIES AND TV)
### [Umbrella](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Full%20Addon%20Setup%20Guides/Umbrella%20Install%20Guide.md) (MOVIES AND TV)

## Recommended Addons
If you're looking for the recommended addons curated from the A4K subreddit ([FenlightAM](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Recommended%20Add-ons.md#fenlightam), [Otaku](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Recommended%20Add-ons.md#otakuotaku-testing), [POV](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Recommended%20Add-ons.md#pov), and [Umbrella](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Recommended%20Add-ons.md#umbrella) are addons that are specifically maintained by moderaters on the subreddit and are the ones recommended most for Movies, TV and Anime) then click on the names of the addons above or click on this [L I N K](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Recommended%20Add-ons.md) to browse the list of other specialized addons (eg. Sports, Live TV, and Free Movie and TV addons that require a VPN instead of Debrid Providers, fair warning they are hit or miss and usually arent worth the effort but i included them so this can be an all-in-one resource).

## Debrid Providers
If you're just looking for a way to setup debrid providers in the most common addons then i've written a guide (Including pictures for each step) on how to do that with Real-Debrid as the example. You can access this page by clicking on "Debrid Providers.md" in the box at the top of this page or click on this [L I N K](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Debrid%20Providers.md)

## External Scraper Modules
FenlightAM and Umbrella require external scraper modules to function so if you are getting an error message popup in either of those addons that says "No External Providers Enabled" (FenlightAM) OR "No Stream Available" (Umbrella) then you most likely havent enabled and authorized an external provider for those addons to use. To install one of the popular scraper modules follow this [L I N K](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/External%20Scraper%20Modules.md) and then go back to the recommended addons [L I N K](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Recommended%20Add-ons.md) and look for the [!NOTE] section of the install guide to learn how to enable it in your addon

## Language Setup
Alot of torrents that are uploaded on the sites that addons scrape end up playing in languages other than English by default. Instead of having to go into the player settings to change this everytime, you can change it Kodi-wide so it'll effect every addon that you use. You can access the guide for this by clicking on "Language Setup.md" in the box at the top of this page or click on this [L I N K](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Language%20Setup.md)

## Installing the error log uploader and getting a clean logfile
Rule #7 on the A4K Subreddit requires you to provide as much information as possible to help make troubleshooting easier for the people who actually know how to help/fix errors that happen in Kodi and its respective addons. One of those bits of information thats really helpful for troubleshooting is an error log. Kodi by itself will not provide you with an easy way to access this error log but theres a specific addon that will upload an error log to a website so you can copy and paste it into your post (certain addons have a built in version of this but I felt it easier to provide a all-in-one solution instead). So i wrote a guide (with pictures) on how to obtain this addon and how to setup for a clean error log to make things easier for the people who know how to troubleshoot. You can access the guide for this by clicking on "Getting A Clean Logfile.md" on the box at the top of this page or clicking on this [L I N K](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Getting%20A%20Clean%20Logfile.md)
