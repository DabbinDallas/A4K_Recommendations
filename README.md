# Most of this is a W.I.P. and was directly forked from the original A4K Repo so if theres anything you want to add, consider [submitting an issue](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/issues)

## Recommended Addons
If you're looking for the recommended addons curated from the A4K subreddit ([FenlightAM](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Recommended%20Add-ons.md#fen-light-am), [Otaku](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Recommended%20Add-ons.md#otakuotaku-testing), [POV](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Recommended%20Add-ons.md#pov), and [Umbrella](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Recommended%20Add-ons.md#umbrella) are addons that are specifically maintained by moderaters on the subreddit and are the ones recommended most for Movies, TV and Anime) then click on "Recommended Add-ons.md" in the above box, click on the names of the addons above or click on this [L I N K](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Recommended%20Add-ons.md)

## Debrid Providers
If you're looking for a way to setup debrid providers in the most common addons then i've written a guide (Including pictures for each step) on how to do that with Real-Debrid as the example. You can access this page by clicking on "Debrid Providers.md" in the above box or click on this [L I N K](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Debrid%20Providers.md)

## Language Setup
Alot of torrents that are uploaded on the sites that addons scrape end up playing in languages other than English by default. Instead of having to go into the player settings to change this everytime, you can change it Kodi-wide so it'll effect every addon that you use. You can access the guide for this by clicking on "Language Setup.md" in the above box or click on this [L I N K](https://github.com/DabbinDallas/A4K_Recommendations/blob/main/Language%20Setup.md)
