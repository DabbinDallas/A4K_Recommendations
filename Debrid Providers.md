# Debrid Provider Instructions
#
## This is my attempt at a comprehensive guide to adding Debrid providers to the most popular add-ons that are recommended and endorsed in the [A4K subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Addons4Kodi/)

> [!NOTE]
> In this guide we'll use Real-Debrid as the example and i will mark the point where the process differs and show the way you add different debrid providers after the RD examples
